        A long time ago in a supermarket far, far away.....
        I introduced my best friend to his partner. When they asked me to perform their wedding I was so honored. 
        I enjoyed writing my script and making sure their ceremony embodied who they are. The couple decided to write their own vowes.
        The bride was concerened where she would keep her vowes as her dress didn't have pockets. I kept her vowes secure until it was
        time for her to read them. 
        Years later my little sister asked me to perform her wedding. I again worked to ensure their cereamony emdodied who they are.
        The couple wanted to incorporate a unity cereamony but wanted something that was unique to them. We worked together to 
        create a ceramony that was authentic to them.
